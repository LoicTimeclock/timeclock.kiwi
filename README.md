## Overview

Timeclock.kiwi is an app for simple employee clocking in and out and time management. It does three things:

1. Allows users to clock in and out using a touch screen tablet as a Kiosk. 
2. Allows users to log time against a job and track materials used and tasks worked on. 
3. Allows admins to setup and manage this data through the web portal.
